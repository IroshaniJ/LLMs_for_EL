{"question": "Given the table title \" Identifying and Correcting Inconsistent Data: A Case Study on Actors' Names.  \", summary \" In this case study, we examine the issue of inconsistent data in a dataset containing actors' names and their corresponding cities and countries. The dataset contained various forms of the same name, including misspellings, typos, and abbreviations. We applied techniques such as string normalization, fuzzy matching, and regular expressions to preprocess the data and identify duplicate entries. Subsequently, we corrected the inconsistencies using rules-based methods and machine learning algorithms like Levenshtein distance and Jaro distance. The results showed an improvement in data accuracy and consistency, allowing for better data analysis and reporting.
